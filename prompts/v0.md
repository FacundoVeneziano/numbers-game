Create a modern number guessing game UI with the following components:
1. A header with game title and theme toggle
2. A secret code input section with 5 digit boxes
3. A guess history section showing previous attempts
4. A new guess input section with color-coded feedback
5. Game controls (add guess, reset)
6. Victory modal with confetti animation

The design should be clean, modern, and use a dark/light theme. Include proper spacing, animations, and visual feedback.
